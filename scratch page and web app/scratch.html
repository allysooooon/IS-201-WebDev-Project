            <p>
                Crocodiles are the largest species of reptiles living on our planet, coming in many different shapes and sizes. From the dwarf crocodile (<i>Osteolaemus tetraspis</i>) spanning a mere 1.5-2. meters in length to the saltwater crocodile (<i>Crocodiles porosus</i>) weighing in at over a whopping 900 kg at 7 meters in length, crocodiles of all sizes are formidable predators.

                As apex predators of whatever region they find themselves in, crocodiles are aggressive and territorial creatures, known to employ sophisticated means of ambush, stalking, and planning when hunting. They target a wide variety of animals such as fish, birds, water buffalo, and even humans. Despite crocodiles growing in rapid numbers over the last couple of decades, attacks on humans are still relatively rare, though often fatal.

                    Crocodiles are sometimes mistaken for alligators. Key characteristics of crocodiles include a more narrow and tapered snout, with both the upper and lower teeth sticking outside of the jaw when closed. They can also be identified by their generally more rugged appearance characterized by a lighter brown or gray color as shown on this picture of a saltwater crocodile. <br>

                    Alligators generally only live in freshwater habitats and are easily identified by their broader, stubbier snouts. Alligators also tend to be darker in color as shown in this picture of the American alligator, and only the upper teeth are visible when the jaw is closed.<br>

                        Crocodiles are super cool. Most people know that when a crocodile bites down, there’s nothing that can force those jaws back open. Which is actually why if you can get a crocodile’s jaws closed (without you in it), it only takes a few wraps of duct tape to keep it closed as their muscle structures in the jaw are designed for crushing down, not opening up. In fact, the saltwater crocodile has a bite force of 3,700 pounds per square inch (psi).

                        With millions of years of evolution’s fine tuning, crocodiles are apex predators and perhaps some of the most sophisticated and terrifying hunters in the world. Often using ambush techniques, crocodiles are capable of waiting motionless under the water for hours at a time. Muscled tails allow crocodiles to propel themselves a full body length vertically or horizontally out of the water. That means if you’re within 20 feet of the shoreline, a saltwater crocodile could burst from the water in the blink of an eye, and easily drag you right down to a watery grave. While crocodiles usually ambush prey from water lines, they have been known to set traps for birds by balancing sticks and nesting materials on their snouts in the water, and they are particularly skilled at recognizing behavior patterns of prey such as times and locations that they visit the water’s edge. This is why most people who are attacked by crocodiles are attacked during regularly scheduled activities like bathing, fishing, or recreation.

                        Native to any body of water, and truly any body of water even centimeters deep can house a crocodile, the crocodile’s greatest strength in killing is adapted to these environments. Because they can’t chew, crocodiles aim to draw prey into the water and then spin in a circle causing the prey to be torn limb from limb. This is called the death roll. Once pieces are torn into swallowable chunks, crocodiles will often dig and stash the remaining parts under rocks in the riverbeds for later. Some crocodiles have even been known to collaborate with each other, chasing prey in a certain direction where another crocodile may lay in wait.

                        The video to the right shows a crocodile expert and caretaker almost get ambushed, showing that these ambush predators are anything but predictable.

                            Crocodiles can be found almost all over the world, mostly limited to tropical and subtropical regions. Most crocodiles live in saltwater, however crocodiles in general are very adaptable and can live in both freshwater and saltwater environments. Generally crocodiles can be found in any body of water, preferring marshy wetlands, mangrove swamps, rivers, lakes, and coastlines. The majority of crocodiles are spread across Africa, Asia, Australia, and the Americas. Of the formidable saltwater crocodile, the largest population is found in Queensland, Australia. The interactive map below shows more information on saltwater crocodiles in Queensland.
